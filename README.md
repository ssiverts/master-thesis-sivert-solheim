**Overview**

This thesis investigated sex differences in muscle strength adaptation following resistance exercise training in untrained adults aged 35–65. 
A 9-week resistance exercise training intervention was conducted to examine sex differences in relative muscle strength gains and whether exercise volume influenced sex differences in lower-body muscle strength gains, with additional focus on sex differences in the correlation between muscle strength gains and muscle hypertrophy.
